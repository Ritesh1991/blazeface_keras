    "We've already chosen an optimizer and set the batch size above, now let's set the remaining training parameters. I'll set one epoch to consist of 1,000 training steps. The next code cell defines a learning rate schedule that replicates the learning rate schedule of the original Caffe implementation for the training of the SSD300 Pascal VOC \"07+12\" model. That model was trained for 120,000 steps with a learning rate of 0.001 for the first 80,000 steps, 0.0001 for the next 20,000 steps, and 0.00001 for the last 20,000 steps. If you're training on a different dataset, define the learning rate schedule however you see fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll set only a few essential Keras callbacks below, feel free to add more callbacks if you want TensorBoard summaries or whatever. We obviously need the learning rate scheduler and we want to save the best models during the training. It also makes sense to continuously stream our training history to a CSV log file after every epoch, because if we didn't do that, in case the training terminates with an exception at some point or if the kernel of this Jupyter notebook dies for some reason or anything like that happens, we would lose the entire history for the trained epochs. Finally, we'll also add a callback that makes sure that the training terminates if the loss becomes `NaN`. Depending on the optimizer you use, it can happen that the loss becomes `NaN` during the first iterations of the training. In later iterations it's less of a risk. For example, I've never seen a `NaN` loss when I trained SSD using an Adam optimizer, but I've seen a `NaN` loss a couple of times during the very first couple of hundred training steps of training a new model when I used an SGD optimizer."

    "In order to reproduce the training of the \"07+12\" model mentioned above, at 1,000 training steps per epoch you'd have to train for 120 epochs. That is going to take really long though, so you might not want to do all 120 epochs in one go and instead train only for a few epochs at a time. You can find a summary of a full training [here](https://github.com/pierluigiferrari/ssd_keras/blob/master/training_summaries/ssd300_pascal_07%2B12_training_summary.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to only run a partial training and resume smoothly later on, there are a few things you should note:\n",
    "1. Always load the full model if you can, rather than building a new model and loading previously saved weights into it. Optimizers like SGD or Adam keep running averages of past gradient moments internally. If you always save and load full models when resuming a training, then the state of the optimizer is maintained and the training picks up exactly where it left off. If you build a new model and load weights into it, the optimizer is being initialized from scratch, which, especially in the case of Adam, leads to small but unnecessary setbacks every time you resume the training with previously saved weights.\n",
    "2. In order for the learning rate scheduler callback above to work properly, `fit_generator()` needs to know which epoch we're in, otherwise it will start with epoch 0 every time you resume the training. Set `initial_epoch` to be the next epoch of your training. Note that this parameter is zero-based, i.e. the first epoch is epoch 0. If you had trained for 10 epochs previously and now you'd want to resume the training from there, you'd set `initial_epoch = 10` (since epoch 10 is the eleventh epoch). Furthermore, set `final_epoch` to the last epoch you want to run. To stick with the previous example, if you had trained for 10 epochs previously and now you'd want to train for another 10 epochs, you'd set `initial_epoch = 10` and `final_epoch = 20`.\n",
    "3. In order for the model checkpoint callback above to work correctly after a kernel restart, set `model_checkpoint.best` to the best validation loss from the previous training. If you don't do this and a new `ModelCheckpoint` object is created after a kernel restart, that object obviously won't know what the last best validation loss was, so it will always save the weights of the first epoch of your new training and record that loss as its new best loss. This isn't super-important, I just wanted to mention it."
